->ROTATION: This package consists of all the algorithms pertaining to array rotation.
            Best algorithm found out was reversal algorithm with O(n) complexity.
            Usually in order to deal with any sorted and rotated array problems the basic approach is to find the
            pivot element(i.e, element which is greater than previous and next element).This can be done by using
            either linear search or binary search techniques.
            Finally, most of the sorted and rotated array problems can be solved by finding pivot using binary search.

->Arrangement:  This package consists of all the problems related to in place arrangements of an array as well as
                shuffling of elements.
                The basic ideology is to make use of pointers pointing to different indexes and perform operations
                accordingly.
